# Brewery Buddy
This is an Android app I created that consumes a Brewery API (http://www.brewerydb.com/developers/docs)

# Java
Libraries I am using  
--Dagger2  
--RxJava/ RxAndroid  
--Retrofit2  
--Butterknife  

# Kotlin
I am using this project to teach myself Kotlin as well. So all new code will be written in Kotlin.  I will leave the working Java for now

# Features
--Search for brewery by name or by location  
--show breweries on a map  
--search for beer by name

# Future features
-- Beer ratings
