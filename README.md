# Brewery Buddy
This is an Android app I created that consumes a Brewery API (http://www.brewerydb.com/developers/docs) and utilizes cutting edge 3rd Party Libraries such as Dagger2, RxJava/ RxAndroid, Retrofit2, Butterknife.

# Kotlin
I am using this project to teach myself Kotlin as well. So all new code will be written in Kotlin.  I will leave the working Java for now
